# VAPT Automation Tool

This repository contains an advanced Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) automation tool designed to detect, exploit, and mitigate security vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs. The tool encompasses sophisticated reconnaissance techniques, supports authentication-based testing, and provides detailed reports with proof-of-concepts and remediation guidelines.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Vulnerability Detection**: Utilize algorithms to automatically identify a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10.

2. **API Vulnerability Assessment**: Extend the tool's capabilities to assess the security of APIs, identifying vulnerabilities such as improper authentication, data exposure, insecure endpoints, Business Logic and Flow Abuse (BOLA, BFLA), injection attacks, etc.

3. **Sophisticated Reconnaissance**: Implement advanced reconnaissance techniques, including active information gathering to gather intelligence about the target web applications and potential attack vectors.

4. **Credential-Based Testing**: Introduce functionality requiring participants to provide credentials for web applications with authentication mechanisms. The tool should simulate authenticated testing scenarios to uncover vulnerabilities that may be hidden behind login screens.
